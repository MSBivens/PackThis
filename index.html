        <h1>PackThis.FYI</h1>
        <p>Frustrated by the constant packing mishaps, especially the time I drove over an hour and a half to the airport only to realize I'd forgotten my wallet, I quickly built this website as a hub for my scattered packing lists since I needed them in one conveinent place. I'll be constantly adding and updating lists here until I can't come up with anything new to add.</p>
